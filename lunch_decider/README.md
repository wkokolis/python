# lunch_decider

## Introduction

Lunch decider 2.0 is a python-based version of my old PHP code that tells you
where to go to get lunch.  It's nothing complicated; just a RNG that pulls from
a correspondingly-numbered list of restaurants.

It may very well tell you to go to the same place multiple days in a row.
